# JR-FE-Challenge
 This repository contains my solution for LTV's Jr FE Challenge 2024.

Succesfully completed all the issues identified by the QA team and some others found, added the phone search feature. I refactored mainly the Javascript form-validation file starting when implementing the new search type and followed up with a final code review and refactor. When developing I like to have good practices and simplify my work, usually researching more efficient ways of performing tasks, creating reusable, generic and dynamic code that will eventually adapt to other parts of the project or even better completely different projects.
In this particular case I decided to not refactor the HTML code because of the simplicity of the project, it would make little difference on the performance. But if it where a bigger project using a framework I would a 100% create separate components for each section, have different pages and most importantly make the search form generic so there is no repetitive code and the validation is easier. Personally I'm a big perfectionist and enjoy challenging myself to have my work match the specs to closest to perfection. When it comes to team work I'm fullfied when other teammates can implement my components and/or design ideas in their own tasks, hence why I love generic, dynamic components. I also value having the same attitude in return form teammates so I try to make my code as clean and clear so others have no major trouble understanding it.
